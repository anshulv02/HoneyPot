# HoneyPot

MHN Admin Deployment
    - For milestone 1 and 2, I created a MHN Admin VM with these attributes: 
         Ubuntu 18.04 Minimal 
         HTTP traffic allowed (port 80) 
         TCP ports 3000 and 10000      
    - I also created a firewall with certain rules 
    - I established SSH access to the VM using the built in command line and I set the superuser email and password.
    
Dioanaea Honeypot Deployment
    - For milestone 3-5, I used Kali Linux on my docker application to run nmap which entailed of a port scan to see all open ports.  I was also able to see all the all the different port scans from around the world when I clicked on my honeypot's attack report. 
    
 Database Backup (session.json)
    - Here, I exported data from my honeypot in JSON format using the MHN admin VM, reduced the file size, and then copied it back to my local machine
